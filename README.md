# Diabetes Prediction - Data Analysis and Decision Tree Modeling

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project! This project guides you through the entire data analysis pipeline, from data cleaning and ingestion to statistical description, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of a Decision Tree model using the scikit-learn library. The dataset provided contains medical condition data with a binary target indicating the presence or absence of diabetes in the patient.

## Project Stages

### 1. Data Ingestion (`/src/1.Data_ingestion.ipynb`)

The Data Ingestion script collects and imports raw data from the provided CSV file, ensuring proper formatting for subsequent analysis.

### 2. Stats Description (`src/2.Stats_description.ipynb`)

The Stats Description script generates comprehensive statistical summaries of the dataset, providing insights into key metrics and distributions, facilitating a deeper understanding of the data.

### 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) (`src/3.EDA.ipynb`)

The EDA script explores the dataset through visualizations and descriptive statistics, uncovering patterns and relationships to inform subsequent modeling decisions.

### 4. Machine Learning Development (`src/4.ML_develop.ipynb`)

The Machine Learning Development script implements, trains, and evaluates a Decision Tree classification model using scikit-learn. The Decision Tree is applied to predict the binary target indicating the likelihood of diabetes in patients. Although the Decision Tree may not be the optimal model initially, we aim to refine its performance through iterative adjustments and optimizations.

## Decision Tree Model

The Decision Tree model is a versatile algorithm suitable for classification tasks. It recursively partitions the dataset based on features, creating a tree structure for making predictions. Known for its interpretability, the Decision Tree provides insights into the features contributing to diabetes prediction.
